# Revealify Project Report

### üéØ Project Goal
Revealify is a Python-based tool that converts PowerPoint (`.pptx`) presentations into fully functional, web-based slides using the Reveal.js framework. The final product aims to let users upload `.pptx` files and view them as modern, animated, interactive slideshows, without needing PowerPoint or downloading any software.

Reveal.js is a popular HTML presentation framework that supports transitions, themes, and dynamic content rendering. By combining it with Python and Flask, Revealify will allow users to interact with their presentations directly in the browser.

## üóì Project Timeline & Progress Log

> üìÜ **Start Date:** March 24, 2025  
> üïí **Target:** 150 hours of work

---

### Week 1 ‚Äî ‚ú® Discovery Phase (Mar 24‚ÄìMar 30) 

**Hours Logged:** ~20 hours

- Began with just the project idea: converting PowerPoint presentations into Reveal.js slides ‚Äî had no clear implementation path at first.
- Explored how web-based presentation frameworks work and why Reveal.js was a suitable choice.
- Studied the Reveal.js documentation to understand its slide structure, themes, transitions, and JavaScript-based navigation system.
- Realized that Reveal.js is not a standalone renderer and would require integration through Node.js and HTML templating.
- Set up a basic Reveal.js test project and experimented with local servers (`npx http-server`) to preview slides.
- In parallel, researched `.pptx` parsing in Python and experimented with the `python-pptx` library.
- Tested content extraction from slides and studied how titles, paragraphs, and textboxes are represented internally.
- Gradually formed the project pipeline: `.pptx` ‚Üí parsed structured data ‚Üí HTML slide sections ‚Üí Reveal.js rendering.

---

### Week 2 ‚Äî ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup & Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Script (Mar 31‚ÄìApr 7)

- Learned Flask fundamentals: routing, templates, static file handling, and `render_template` usage  
- Explored Flask project structure conventions and set up a scalable layout  
- Studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript essentials to support frontend development  
- Designed and implemented a fully working Flask web app with:  
  - Upload form supporting `.pptx` file validation  
  - Clean routing with `/`, `/upload`, and `/view`  
  - Reveal.js preview integration using the converted `slides.html`  
- Built a stylish, modern UI with:

- Debugged Reveal.js and static asset serving issues, ensuring smooth client-side loading  
- Iteratively refined layout, buttons, icons, hover effects, and user flow for a responsive feel  

---

### Week 5 ‚Äî üìä Table Support & Final Reveal.js Styling (Apr 21‚ÄìApr 28)

**Hours Logged:** ~15 hours

- Extended the XML parser to support tables using `graphicFrame` + `<a:tbl>`  
- Maintained slide content ordering to include both paragraphs and tables without breaking sequence  
- Implemented a new `TableContent` class inheriting from `SlideContent` to generate responsive HTML `<table>` output  
- Integrated table blocks into Reveal.js slides while maintaining support for fragments and titles  
- Debugged complex rendering issues with table width, scrolling, and overflow behavior  
- Refined table HTML with `r-stretch`, `overflow-x/overflow-y: auto`, and wrapping strategies for wide layouts  
- Investigated Reveal.js limitations around scroll plugins and proposed pure-CSS fallback solutions  
- Rewrote and tested responsive CSS rules to preserve Reveal‚Äôs native style while allowing fit-to-slide tables  
- Improved `view.css` table layout, borders, wrapping, vertical alignment, and font balance  
- Maintained modularity and readability in `slide.py`, `converter.py`, and `xml_parser.py` despite expanding functionality
- Added a new **theme selector dropdown** to the homepage for choosing a Reveal.js theme before upload with over than 10 reveal themes, styled with emojis and modern dark UI 
- Finalized the user experience: a clean, modern ‚ÄúChoose a Reveal.js Theme‚Äù interaction above the upload button  
- Introduced <div class="r-fit-text"> wrapping for better dynamic fitting of text contents inside slides
- Refined scrolling behavior for wide tables with overflow-x/overflow-y: auto inside slides

> **Heavy UI trial-and-error and testing** contributed to ~15 hours of focused work across multiple debugging sessions.

### Week 6 ‚Äî ‚ú® Rich Text Styling & Table Dimension Precision (Apr 29‚ÄìMay 5)

**Hours Logged:** ~8 hours

- Added support for **precise table positioning and dimensions**, including `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` in percentage of slide size  
- Extracted and applied **column widths** from `<a:tblGrid>` for more faithful Reveal.js table rendering  
- Enhanced the `XmlParser` to output detailed table shape geometry using EMUs-to-percent conversion logic  
- Introduced support for **styled inline text** inside paragraphs and bullets by parsing `<a:r>` and `<a:rPr>`  
- Supported rich formatting: **bold**, *italic*, <u>underline</u>, and <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">strikethrough</span> using HTML equivalents (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<span>`)  
- Updated `ParagraphContent` and `BulletNode` to render styled `runs` inline without breaking text flow  
- Ensured full compatibility with existing bullet nesting and paragraph grouping logic  
- Cleaned up item dispatching logic in `converter.py` to only process `"text"` and `"table"` types, skipping unhandled shapes safely  

---

### Week 7 ‚Äî üîÑ Switched to python-pptx & Rich Text Table Cells (May 6‚ÄìMay 12)

**Hours Logged:** ~12 hours

- Started over, transitioning from manual XML parsing to using the `python-pptx` library, with modifications for advanced extraction when needed  
- Added robust support for text shape extraction and absolute positioning, including precise `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` as percentages of slide dimensions  
- After implementing exact positioning, I encountered a bug where shapes were overlapping and collapsing for some reason. Spent many hours trying to figure out what was causing shapes to overlap; eventually I resolved it. 
- Extended rich text styling to table cells, supporting bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough within table content  
- Developed and integrated JavaScript font fitting logic to dynamically shrink text within text shapes until it fits the bounding box  
- Encountered a bug where `.scrollHeight` remained constant despite font shrinking, causing text to hit the minimum font-size rather than fit naturally; this issue remains unresolved  
- Enhanced overall code structure for future extensibility and easier handling of Reveal.js HTML rendering

## üìÖ Daily Breakdown Summary (Mar 24‚ÄìMay 12)

> Estimated average: ~4-5 hours/day, increasing toward the later stages

- Early days focused on XML parsing and debugging, PowerPoint structure, and content classification (~4‚Äì5 hours/day)  
- Mid-phase included refactoring into OOP, edge case handling and debugging , and fragment logic in Reveal.js  
- Recent days (Week 4) were heavier due to Flask integration, UI design, and extensive debugging of styling and rendering logic  
- Progress has been consistently iterative, with code improvements, testing cycles, and user experience polish across both backend and frontend sides
- Heavy trial-and-error and debugging accompanied nearly every new conversion feature, with multiple sessions often requiring several focused hours each to resolve edge cases and ensure reliable results.
...makes it clear that not all hours were ‚Äúpure coding‚Äù‚Äîlots went into thoughtful debugging and quality.

Total time logged so far: **100 hours / 150 hours**
